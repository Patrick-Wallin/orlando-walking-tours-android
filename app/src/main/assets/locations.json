It is the only bridge of its kind in the City of Orlando and perhaps Florida. In 1933, the Civitan Club requested Mayor S.Y. Way to approve converting the surrounding overgrown, city-owned space to a park. In 1935, they broke ground and with the aid of Botanist Mulford B. Foster laid out plantings to preserve native plants and planted trees and shrubs bearing berries to encourage a bird sanctuary. Local groups including The Orlando Garden Club, First Methodist Church, employees of Landmark Image Date listed Narrative Dickson Ives Department Store, and the Sentinel Star newspaper adopted plots within the park to beautify. They dedicated H.H. Dickson Azalea Park on February 21, 1937, honoring Henry Hill Dickson, a pioneer Orlando businessman and advocate of the Cityâs beautification. The park, which includes a series of terraces, bridges, walls, stairs, and paths, is Orlandoâs only cultural landscape designated a historic Landmark.

The Beacham hosted vaudeville acts from 1921 to 1936, when it switched to showing first-run movies. They continued until 1975, when live musical acts appeared at what was then called the Great Southern Music Hall. For a time, it was Laser World, and then Moulin Orange, with live musical shows.

It is the only bridge of its kind in the City of Orlando and perhaps Florida. In 1933, the Civitan Club requested Mayor S.Y. Way to approve converting the surrounding overgrown, city-owned space to a park. In 1935, they broke ground and with the aid of Botanist Mulford B. Foster laid out plantings to preserve native plants and planted trees and shrubs bearing berries to encourage a bird sanctuary. Local groups including The Orlando Garden Club, First Methodist Church, employees of Landmark Image Date listed Narrative Dickson Ives Department Store, and the Sentinel Star newspaper adopted plots within the park to beautify. They dedicated H.H. Dickson Azalea Park on February 21, 1937, honoring Henry Hill Dickson, a pioneer Orlando businessman and advocate of the Cityâs beautification. The park, which includes a series of terraces, bridges, walls, stairs, and paths, is Orlandoâs only cultural landscape designated a historic Landmark.

Kerouac became famous overnight on September 5, 1957, when The New York Times gave a rave review. Here, he wrote the bookâs follow-up The Dharma Bums in twelve days using a rented typewriter and a roll of teletype paper taped together as a continuous scroll. Because the home had no air conditioning, Kerouac mostly wrote at night or underneath the large oak in the backyard. Having arrived penniless and renting the home with his mother, he left for New York in 1958 as a famous American writer. Today, the property is managed by the Jack Kerouac Writer in Residence Project of Orlando, a nonprofit group that opens the home to a writer or poet to live and write, rent free. In 1998, the group renovated the c. 1920 Frame Vernacular house to look like it did when Kerouac lived there. In 2013, The Jack Kerouac House became the newest site in Orlando to be placed on National Register of Historic Places.",

Designer Maurice Kressly designed several of Orlandoâs important commercial and institutional buildings of the 1920s-40s. The central entrance bay with cascading rows of recessed brick arches is detailed with thin slivers of tile radiating from the arch under a small gable roof with flared eaves. Curved brick steps lead to the original double wood doors. Originally built with 6 classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria, and a playground, today the school consists of a group of one story brick buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1990s constructed in a rectangular pattern with two courtyards. Although altered, Kaley Street School maintains its architectural integrity. \"",

The sign was built in San Diego and shipped to Orlando where the Harper Neon Company installed the sign. The Plaza Theatre opened in 1963, with the John Wayne movie, âMcLintockâ. Wayne, along with other movie stars of the day, including Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Maureen OâHara, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Rock Hudson, and Jack Lemon sent telegrams of congratulations and good wishes to the theater that were posted in the lobby. The Plaza Theatre introduced Orlando moviegoers to twin screens, rocking-chair seats, angle seating, and wider screens. Architect Robert E. Collins also designed the underwater theater at Weeki Wachee and buildings in Peru and New York City. The movie theater closed in 1992 and the building was rehabilitated.

Shingle style mansion in Orlando. It features horizontal bands of shingles in various shapes including the diamond-patterned shingles on the roof of the turret. One of Orlandoâs first millionaire families, the Phillipsâ were prominent supporters of the arts, hosting many cultural events at the house. Their support continues through Dr. Phillips, Inc., which provides grants to educational and cultural organizations. Now a bed and breakfast, it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

In 1954, Citrus Fruit Products (now Dr. Phillips, Inc.), owned the property and hired L. Alex Hatton, a local architect, to design the International Style building for their new tenants, Porter Paints. The black, white, and orange striped sign are part of the buildingâs outer walls and made of porcelain enamel-faced metal panels, the only example of this material used for a pre-1966 non-illuminated sign in the City. In 1995, Porter Paints became the first company to take advantage of the historic sign ordinance that protects historic signs that do not conform to current codes. The Porter Paints signâs structure, material, color, and graphics are important elements to the overall composition of the small store.",
